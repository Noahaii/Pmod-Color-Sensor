# Pmod-Color-Sensor
## Description
---
This project's objective was to utilize Digilent's Pmod COLOR component 
and connnect to the zybo board and get real time output of what color it 
senses. 
If configured correctly, users may see the hexcode onto Vitis due to the 
C code source file. The python source file comes in to read that hexcode 
that is generated and uses the pygame library to display a screen which 
will show the color that is bneing represent visually rather than in 
hexcode.
